    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information on your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or a specific computational trick), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",
    "* When describing an observation please use English language, too\n",

    "This notebook allows you for using boxplots to detect anomalies. Try to interpret the boxplot. \n",

    "If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n",
    "Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n",

    "<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n",
    "1. import the notebook to Google Colab or use your local machine.\n",
    "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date. \n",
    "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
    "3. read the entire notebook carefully \n",
    "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
    "    * run the notebook for the first time. \n",
    "4. take the three data sets from exercize 1 and create a boxplot for each of them\n",
    "5. interpret the visual results and describe them\n",
    "6. how can you test your data for being normally distributed? \n",
